## Description
Kickstarter_3.0 is a crowdfunding platform build on top of Ethereum's testnet. The purpose of building this project is to learn how to write,test and deploy a solidity smart contract onto the blockchain, followed by integrating it with a user-intertafce written in React that is both interactive and mobile-responsive.

- Using use/createContext hooks for global state management
- EventListeners to update state 
- Custom error handling 
- Higher order components ( HOC ) for building the main pages 
- Mobile responsive design 
- Enums, events, structs as well as learning to think and write smart contract in a simple and logical manner


## In Progress 
- Writing out unit tests for edge cases ( smart contract ) 
- Learning how to use CI/CD for deployment
